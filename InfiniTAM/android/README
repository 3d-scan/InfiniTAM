Clumsy attempt at providing an Android build environment for the project

  InfiniTAM



To make it build:

- Create a file named 'local.properties' with the content:

  sdk.dir=/path/to/your/local/android/android-sdk-linux


To get it to run in release mode:

- Create a keystore:

  keytool -genkey -v -keystore my-release-key.keystore -alias alias_name \
          -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000

- Tell the build environment about your keystore by adding the following into
  a file named 'ant.properties':

  key.store=my-release-key.keystore
  key.alias=alias_name
  key.store.password=xxx
  key.alias.password=xxx


To complain:

- Don't contact me!
